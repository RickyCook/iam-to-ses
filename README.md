# IAM to SES
Tiny Python 2/3 CLI script to generate SES SMTP password from an IAM secret access key.

```
usage: iam-to-ses.py IAM_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```
## Motivation
Every time I've gone to do this, it's been a hastle to remember how. Up until now, I've been using a bash script that somebody wrote, but it's not very robust and recently stopped working. This should continue working for the forseeable future.
